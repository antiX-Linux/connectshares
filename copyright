This program attempts to locate remote shares on Windows and Samba
servers as well as NFS servers in the same subnet as the local IP
address. Any remote shares found that are mounted in the local file
system are indicated.

It was written to be a lightweight alternative to Samba's smbtree
and a friendlier alternative to NFS's showmount.
